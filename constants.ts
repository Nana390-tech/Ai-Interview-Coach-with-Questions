    exampleAnswer: "My main strength is that I am a good team player. I like sharing ideas and helping my teammates.

    question: "Do you like working independently or in teams? Why/Why not?",
    exampleAnswer: "I enjoy both. I like working in teams because we can share different ideas and learn from each other. But I can also work well by myself. When I need to focus on a difficult task, I can concentrate and finish my work alone. I think being flexible is important in any job."

    question: "Tell me about a time when you worked in a team. What was challenging? What did you enjoy?",
    exampleAnswer: "Last semester, I worked on a marketing project with three classmates. The most challenging part was that we all had different schedules. To solve this, we created a shared online calendar to find times to meet. I really enjoyed creating the final presentation together. We combined all our ideas, and it felt great to see our hard work pay off."

    question: "Tell me about a time when you had to explain something difficult to a coworker or classmate. How did you make sure they understood?",
    exampleAnswer: "In my programming class, my friend did not understand a new concept. It was difficult because it was very abstract. I explained it to him using a simple example from real life. I drew a diagram on a piece of paper to show him the steps. I asked him questions to check if he understood. In the end, he did, and I was happy I could help."

    question: "Tell me about a challenge/conflict you had and how you dealt with it.",
    exampleAnswer: "In a group project, two members had very different ideas and couldn't agree. It was a challenge for our team. I listened to both of them to understand their points of view. Then, I suggested we try to find a solution that included a little bit of both ideas. We talked about it and found a compromise that everyone was happy with. We learned that communication is very important."
